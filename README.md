# Mini JS Projects

This is a repository of all the basic projects that I created to practice JavaScript. I used `Tailwind CSS` for the styling and `Vanilla JavaScript` for the functionality.

The list of the project components created are:
- Color Generator
- Countdown Timer
- Grocery Bud
- Lorem Ipsum
- Menu
- Modal
- Navbar
- Questions
- Random Password Generator
- Review
- Scroll
- Sidebar
- Simple Counter
- Tabs
- Video

All these projects were inspired by [John Smilga (Coding Addict)](https://www.vanillajavascriptprojects.com/). From a beginners point of view all of these were great starter mini projects to get some hands on experience with JS.
